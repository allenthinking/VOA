[00:00.12]California is set to open its roads up for the first time
[00:05.58]to self-driving vehicles with no human drivers.
[00:11.16]The Department of Motor Vehicles announced plans to allow testing
[00:17.76]on state roads later this year of truly driverless cars.
[00:24.63]Until now, California has only allowed testing of autonomous vehicles
[00:33.08]with a driver ready to take over if something goes wrong.
[00:38.13]The proposed change would allow testing of vehicles
[00:43.74]with no steering wheel or pedal controls.
[00:47.96]However, any driverless vehicle being tested
[00:53.16]must be remotely controllable and able to stop itself in an emergency.
[01:01.00]A hearing will be held next month to get public comments on the issue
[01:08.32]before the change can take effect.
[01:12.56]Officials say they hope the new rules can receive final approval by December.
[01:20.73]The proposed rules open the path for self-driving cars to be widely sold
[01:28.16]and used throughout the state, officials said.
[01:33.52]Truly driverless vehicles could be available for sale in California as early as 2018.
[01:43.41]The cars must also meet all federal safety requirements to be allowed on California roads.
[01:53.56]The U.S. government released its own set of guidelines for driverless vehicles last September.
[02:03.28]Officials said the guidelines were intended to bring about a "responsible introduction"
[02:11.76]of autonomous technology in a "safe, clean, efficient" way.
[02:18.28]California is the largest automobile market in the United States.
[02:25.48]Currently, 27 companies have permission to test autonomous vehicles on the state's public roads.
[02:35.91]These include major U.S. and foreign carmakers,
[02:41.36]as well as technology companies like Google and Uber.
[02:47.48]Ride-sharing company Uber was forced to pull its test cars out of California last December
[02:56.92]after a dispute with officials over required permits.
[03:01.90]Uber had argued it did not need state permits for testing
[03:07.67]because its vehicles were not "fully autonomous."
[03:13.40]But last week, Uber finally gave in to state officials
[03:18.10]and got the required permit to test its self-driving cars in California.
